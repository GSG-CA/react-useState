# REACT State and HOOKS

Now that you have been introduced to the concept of React, how to render data, and how to pass data from one component to another using props, but what if we wanted to change our component UI based on its internal logic or change it based on some data or some actions that happen inside the component like clicking a button? here comes the role of the component state and comes to the use of React Hooks, so what is a state in React and what are Hooks?

### What is State?
`State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component`

State is a representation of parts of the app, which allow the component to keep track of the values that can change, in other words, it's a way for making a dynamic component that can be changed based on some actions.
Any change of the state will trigger the render of the component and change the UI.


### What are Hooks?
Hooks are functions that provide a way to create and control the component state and a way to perform side effects.
